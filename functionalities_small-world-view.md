## Functionlities of the Small World View
This websites operates on the result data of the study. The results can be filtered by:
1. Corpus: VeBiDraCor includes 14 different language-specific subcopora
2. Number of Segments (which we called "Struc")
3. Year of Publication (which we called "Hist")

According to the filters the table (below) with the corpus overview and the two figures are updated. The caculation of swn is corpus independent, but the calculation of swt and therefore sft depends on the corpus set up and are recalculated with every update of the filters.

To investigate a single corpus or the networks of single plays switch to the **Corpus Play View** in the header.

### Recreation of the results
To recreate the subcopora that we used in the paper, set the filter as follows:
* VeBiDraCor\_Struc: Number of segments = 5
* VeBiDraCor\_Struc\_Hist: Number of segments = 5 and Year of Publication = 1500 
To recreate Figure 8: Only change the corpus filter to: ger, fre, shake, rus
